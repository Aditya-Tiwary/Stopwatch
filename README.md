Stopwatch

This is a simple stopwatch web application that allows users to time events by measuring the elapsed time with hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds.

Getting Started

To use the stopwatch application, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. The user interface displays a digital stopwatch with an initial value of "00 hr 00 min 00 sec 00". The user can start, stop, and reset the stopwatch using the corresponding buttons.
